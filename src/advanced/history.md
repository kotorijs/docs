On May In 2023 years,AI chat models(mainly referred to Claude and OpenAi) rose,I was interested in them.
Many people use python to build QQ chatbot and connect to the AI chat models,but as a JavaScript developer,
I decided to use JavaScript to do the same thing (Just for fun and to learn).Of course,at that time I didn't know that
the community had already the chatbot framework base on Node.js.

At first,I only intended to implement QQ platform's access and the project's name is **ISLABot**.The name could be
followed 2022 years and more early,at that time I was develop another chatbot framework's plugins by chinese
language(be like shit),I named the plugin **ISLABot**(was from the anime character).I forgot the time when started use
typescript as developing language for the project.The first commit to github is at 14th on June and the project
had already renamed **Kotori Bot**,at the some time I fell in love with using romaji to named the project.

During the 0.x ~ 1.0 version,I had been adapted to QQ platform(base on [go-cqhttp](https://github.com/Mrs4s/go-cqhttp)),
During that time,I referred to many similar projects's api interface designs and thinkings.Finally,I released `v1.0` at
29th on Dec In 2023 and moved repository from my own account [biyuehu/kotori-bot](https://github.com/biyuehu/kotori-bot)
to organization account [kotorijs/kotori](https://github.com/kotorijs/kotori).

Waiting update...
